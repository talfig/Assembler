<!-- Project Background and Objectives -->
<h2 id="project-background-and-objectives">üìù Project Background and Objectives</h2>

As is known, there are many programming languages, and a large number of programs written in different languages can run on the same computer. How does the computer recognize so many languages? The answer is simple: the computer actually understands only one language: machine code, which is stored in memory as a sequence of binary digits. This code is divided by the Central Processing Unit (CPU) into small segments with meaning: instructions, addresses, and data.

In fact, computer memory is an array of bits, usually grouped into fixed-size units (bytes, words). There is no physical difference, visible to an unskilled eye, between the part of memory where a program is located and the rest of the memory.

The CPU can perform a variety of simple operations called machine instructions, using the registers within the CPU and the computer memory. Examples include transferring a number from memory to a register or back, adding 1 to a number in a register, checking if a number in a register is zero, and performing addition and subtraction between two registers.

Machine instructions and their combinations make up the program as it is loaded into memory. Each source program (the program as written by the programmer) will eventually be translated into this final form by a special software tool.

The CPU executes code in the format of machine language. This is a sequence of bits representing a binary encoding of a series of machine instructions making up the program. This code is not readable to users and thus it is not convenient to write or read programs directly in machine language. Assembly language allows representing machine instructions in a more symbolic and user-friendly manner. However, it still needs to be translated into machine code for the program to run on the computer. This translation is done by a tool called an assembler.

Each CPU model (i.e., each computer architecture) has its own specific machine language and, correspondingly, its own specific assembly language. Therefore, each assembler (translation tool) is dedicated and unique to each CPU.

The task of the assembler is to create a file containing machine code from a given source file written in assembly language. This is the first step in the process of getting a program ready to run on computer hardware. The subsequent steps are linking and loading, but these are not covered in this context.

The goal of this project is to write an assembler (i.e., a program that translates into machine code) for a specifically defined assembly language for this project.

<!-- Hardware -->
<h2 id="hardware">üñ•Ô∏è Hardware</h2>

- The computer in this project is comprised of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) - a work unit containing registers and RAM. Some of the memory also serves as a stack.

- The CPU contains 8 general registers: `r0, r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7`. Each register is 15 bits in size, with the least significant bit labeled as bit 0 and the most significant bit as bit 14. The content of the registers is initialized to 0. Register names are always written with a lowercase 'r'.

- Additionally, the CPU contains a register named PSW (program status word), which contains several flags representing the status of the program at any given moment. These flags are typically used to indicate conditions like carry or overflow after arithmetic operations.

- The memory size is 4096 bytes, addressed from 0-4095, with each address being 15 bits long. The memory content is treated as "words", similar to registers.

- The machine works with a big-endian system, meaning the most significant byte is stored at the smallest memory address. The numbers are stored using 2's complement (negative numbers), and characters are encoded in ASCII.

<!-- Assembly Language Syntax -->
<h2 id="assembly-language-syntax">‚úçÔ∏è Assembly Language Syntax</h2>

Write your assembly code with these cool features:

<!-- Macros -->
<h3 id="macros">üóÉÔ∏è Macros</h3>

Define macros with macr <macro_name>, include a series of instructions, and close with endmacr. This helps to simplify repetitive code.

Example:

```assembly
macr myMacro
    mov r1, r2
    add r3, r4
endmacr
```

<!-- Directives -->
<h3 id="directives">üóíÔ∏è Directives</h3>

Use special commands like `.entry`, `.extern`, and more to manage your code's structure.

Example:

```assembly
.extern start
.entry end
.string "abcd"
.data 1, -5, 0
```

<!-- Instructions -->
<h3 id="instructions">üó∫Ô∏è Instructions</h3>

Use our supported opcodes to perform operations in your assembly code. Each opcode corresponds to a specific machine instruction.

Example:

```assembly
mov r1, r2
add r3, r4
jmp start
```

<!-- Labels -->
<h3 id="labels1">üè∑Ô∏è Labels</h3>

Define and use labels in your code.

Example:

```assembly
label: mov r1, r2
```

Each instruction and operation is carefully designed to give you complete control over your assembly code, allowing you to write efficient and functional programs.

<!-- Addressing Methods (Modes) -->
<h2 id="addressing-methods-modes">üìå Addressing Methods (Modes)</h2>

Understanding the addressing methods used in our assembler is key to writing effective assembly code. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the supported addressing methods:

- **(0) Immediate Addressing:**
  - Format: `#number`
  - In this mode, the operand is a constant value. For example, mov #5, r1 loads the value 5 directly into register r1.
- **(1) Direct Addressing:**
  - Format: `label`
  - This mode uses a direct reference to a memory location. For example, mov label, r2 moves the value stored at label into register r2.
- **(2) Indirect Addressing:**
  - Format: `*register`
  -  This method accesses memory indirectly through a register. For example, mov *r3, r4 moves the value pointed by r3 into r4.
- **(3) Indexed Addressing:**
  - Format: `register`
  - This method accesses the value of a base register. For instance, mov r5, r6 loads the value from the memory location of r5 into r6.

Each addressing method allows for flexible data manipulation, enabling you to write efficient and powerful assembly code.

<!-- First Word Encoding -->
<h2 id="first-word-encoding">üë®‚Äçüíª First Word Encoding</h2>

The assembler encodes the first word of each instruction using the following format:

| 14  | 13  | 12  | 11  | 10  |  9  |  8  |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|
| Opcode |||| Source operand |||| Destination operand |||| The field A,R,E |||
| Fourth bit | Third bit | Second bit | First bit | Method 3 | Method 2 | Method 1 | Method 0 | Method 3 | Method 2 | Method 1 | Method 0 |  A  |  R  |  E  |

<!-- Addressing Methods Encoding -->
<h2 id="addressing-methods-encoding">üß† Addressing Methods Encoding</h2>

<!-- Immediate Addressing -->
<h3 id="immediate-addressing">‚ö° Immediate Addressing</h3>

- **Operand Representation:** The operand itself, which is a 12-bit two's complement integer, is contained in bits 14-3 of the word.
- **A,R,E Bits:** In immediate addressing, the `A` bit is set to 1, and the other two bits (`R`, `E`) are set to 0.

<!-- Direct Addressing -->
<h3 id="direct-addressing">üèπ Direct Addressing</h3>

- **Operand Representation:** The operand is a memory address, with the word at this address in memory being the operand. The address is represented as a 12-bit unsigned number in bits 14-3 of the word.
- **A,R,E Bits:** 
  - If the address is internal (i.e., within the current source file), the `R` bit is set to 1, and the `A` and `E` bits are set to 0.
  - If the address is external (i.e., from another source file), the `E` bit is set to 1, and the `A` and `R` bits are set to 0.

<!-- Indirect Register Addressing -->
<h3 id="indirect-register-addressing">üì≤ Indirect Register Addressing</h3>

- **Operand Representation:** Accesses memory through a pointer in a register. The content of the register is a memory address, and the word at this address is the operand. The address is represented as a 15-bit unsigned number in the register.
- **A,R,E Bits:** In indirect register addressing, the `A` bit is set to 1, and the other two bits (`R`, `E`) are set to 0.
- **Register Coding:**
  - If the operand is a destination, bits 5-3 of the word contain the register number used as a pointer.
  - If the operand is a source, bits 8-6 of the word contain the register number used as a pointer.
  - If there are two operands using indirect register addressing, both registers share the same word, with bits 5-3 containing the destination register and bits 8-6 containing the source register.

<!-- Direct Register Addressing -->
<h3 id="direct-register-addressing">üö™ Direct Register Addressing</h3>

- **Operand Representation:** The operand is a direct register.
- **A,R,E Bits:** In direct register addressing, the `A` bit is set to 1, and the other two bits (`R`, `E`) are set to 0.
- **Register Coding:**
  - If the register is a destination, bits 5-3 of the word contain the register number.
  - If the register is a source, bits 8-6 of the word contain the register number.
  - If there are two operands using either direct register or indirect register addressing, both registers share the same word, with bits 5-3 containing the destination register and bits 8-6 containing the source register.

<!-- Unused Bits -->
<h3 id="unused-bits">üóëÔ∏è Unused Bits</h3>

- Any bits in the instruction word that are not used should be set to 0.

<!-- Types of Statements in Assembly Language -->
<h2 id="types-of-statements-in-assembly-language">üìö Types of Statements in Assembly Language</h2>

The maximum length of a line in the source file is 80 characters (excluding the 
newline character `\n`).

Assembly language typically includes four types of statements:

| **Statement Type**    | **Explanation**                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Empty Statement**    | A line that contains only whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.). Essentially, it does nothing and will be ignored during compilation. |
| **Comment Statement**  | A line beginning with a semicolon `;` which is used to comment out code or add explanations in the assembly source. These are also ignored by the assembler. |
| **Instruction Statement** | A line containing valid assembly code that the assembler will translate into machine language. These lines typically contain an opcode and operands. |
| **Directive Statement**  | A line that starts with a dot `.` followed by a directive keyword (e.g., `.entry`, `.extern`). These lines instruct the assembler on how to process the subsequent code. |

<!-- Instruction Statements -->
<h2 id="instruction-statements">üß∞ Instruction Statements</h2>

<!-- .data Instruction -->
<h3 id="data-instruction">üìä ".data" Instruction</h3>

- The `.data` instruction allocates space in the data image to store the specified integer values.
- Parameters: One or more legal integers separated by commas.

Example:

  ```assembly
  .data 7, -57, +17, 9
  ```

In this example, the assembler allocates four consecutive words in the data image for the numbers. If a label is defined, it will be associated with the address of the first value.

```assembly
XYZ: .data 7, -57, +17, 9
```

Here, XYZ is a label associated with the address of the first value (7). This label can be referenced in the program.

<!-- .string Instruction -->
<h3 id="string-instruction">üìë ".string" Instruction</h3>

- The `.string` instruction allocates space in the data image to store a string.
- Parameters: A single legal string enclosed in double quotes.

Example:

```assembly
STR: .string "abcdef"
```
The string "abcdef" is stored in the data image with each character in a separate word, followed by a `0` to indicate the end of the string. The label `STR` refers to the address of the first character.

<!-- .entry Instruction -->
<h3 id="entry-instruction">üì• ".entry" Instruction</h3>

- The `.entry` instruction identifies a label that can be referenced from other assembly source files.
- Parameters: A single label name defined in the current source file.

Example:

```assembly
.entry HELLO
```

This instruction marks the label HELLO as available for external reference.

<!-- .extern Instruction -->
<h3 id="extern-instruction">üåê ".extern" Instruction</h3>

- The `.extern` instruction indicates that a label is defined in another source file.
- Parameters: A single label name that is defined externally.

Example:

```assembly
.extern HELLO
```

This indicates that the label HELLO is defined in another source file and will be linked accordingly.

<!-- Instruction Fields -->
<h2 id="instruction-fields">üõë Instruction Fields</h2>

<!-- Labels -->
<h3 id="labels2">üè∑Ô∏è Labels</h3>

- A label is a symbolic representation of an address in memory.
- Syntax:
  -  Maximum length: 31 characters.
  -  Ends with a colon `:`, which must be directly attached to the label name without spaces.

Example:

```assembly
Hello:
X:
He10:
```

Labels are case-sensitive and must be unique within the same file.

<!-- Numbers -->
<h3 id="numbers">üî¢ Numbers</h3>

- Legal numbers are decimal integers that can be positive or negative.

Example:

```assembly
123, -57, +17
```

<!-- Strings -->
<h3 id="strings">üî† Strings</h3>

- A legal string is a sequence of printable ASCII characters enclosed in double quotes.

Example:

```assembly
"hello world"
```

<!-- Instruction Statement Formats -->
<h2 id="instruction-statement-formats">üìã Instruction Statement Formats</h2>

<!-- Two-Operand Instruction -->
<h3 id="two-operand-instruction">2Ô∏è‚É£ Two-Operand Instruction</h3>

- Format: `label: opcode source-operand, target-operand`

Example:

```assembly
HELLO: add r7, B
```

<!-- One-Operand Instruction -->
<h3 id="one-operand-instruction">1Ô∏è‚É£ One-Operand Instruction</h3>

- Format: `label: opcode target-operand`

Example:

```assembly
HELLO: bne XYZ
```

<!-- No-Operand Instruction -->
<h3 id="no-operand-instruction">0Ô∏è‚É£ No-Operand Instruction</h3>

- Format: `label: opcode`

Example:

```assembly
END: stop
```

<!-- Linking and Loading: A,R,E Field Encoding -->
<h2 id="linking-and-loading-a-r-e-field-encoding">üîç Linking and Loading: A,R,E Field Encoding</h2>

In every machine code instruction (not data), the assembler inserts specific information into the A, R, E field to facilitate the linking and loading process. This field contains three bits: A, R, and E, which indicate how the word should be treated when the program is loaded into memory for execution. The assembler initially generates code as if it were to be loaded at a start address. The information in these bits allows the code to be relocated to any address in memory without requiring reassembly.

<!-- The A,R,E Bits -->
<h2 id="the-a-r-e-bits">üì° The A,R,E Bits</h2>

- **A (Absolute):** 
  - If the A bit is set to 1, it means the word's content is independent of the memory location where the program is loaded during execution (e.g., an immediate operand).
- **R (Relocatable):**
  - If the R bit is set to 1, it indicates that the word's content depends on the actual memory location where the program will be loaded (e.g., an internal label address).
- **E (External):**
  - If the E bit is set to 1, the word's content is dependent on the value of an external symbol (e.g., a label defined in another source file).

These bits are set according to the addressing modes used and the location of the symbols within the program, ensuring that the final machine code is adaptable for different memory layouts during execution.

<!-- Macro Handling -->
<h2 id="macro-handling">üìê Macro Handling</h2>

When the assembler receives an assembly program, it first expands all macros before proceeding with the assembly process. If there are macros, the assembler generates an expanded program, which is then assembled into machine code. Here's how a sample program looks before and after macro expansion:

Before Macro Expansion:

```assembly
MAIN: add r3, LIST
LOOP: prn #48
macr m_macr
cmp r3, #-6
bne END
endmacr
lea STR, r6
inc r6
mov *r6, K
sub rl, r4
m_macr
dec K
jmp LOOP
END: stop
STR: .string "abcd"
LIST: .data 6, -9
K: .data 31
```

After Macro Expansion:

```assembly
MAIN: add r3, LIST
LOOP: prn #48
lea STR, r6
inc r6
mov *r6, K
sub rl, r4
cmp r3, #-6
bne END
dec K
jmp LOOP
END: stop
STR: .string "abcd"
LIST: .data 6, -9
K: .data 31
```

<!-- Supported Operations and Addressing Methods -->
<h2 id="supported-operations-and-addressing-methods">‚öôÔ∏è Supported Operations and Addressing Methods</h2>

Our assembler supports the following operations and the corresponding addressing methods:

| **Operation** | **Source Operand Addressing Methods** | **Destination Operand Addressing Methods** |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `mov`         | 0,1,2,3                             | 1,2,3                                    |

<!-- Assembler with Two Passes -->
<h2 id="assembler-with-two-passes">üîÅ Assembler with Two Passes</h2>

In the first pass of the assembler, the program reads the assembly code to determine the symbols (labels) appearing in the program, assigns an address to each symbol, and builds the symbol table. In the second pass, using the symbol table, the assembler generates the actual machine code.

Our assembler handles the following instructions during the second pass: `mov`, `jmp`, `prn`, `sub`, `cmp`, `inc`, `bne`, `stop`. The corresponding machine code is generated based on the opcode and the operands provided.

Additionally, the assembler should replace the symbols `K`, `STR`, `LIST`, `MAIN`, `LOOP`, `END` with the memory addresses where each corresponding data or instruction is located.

<!-- First Pass -->
<h3 id="first-pass">üìà First Pass</h3>

In the first pass, rules are required to determine the address to be assigned to each symbol. The basic principle is to count the memory locations occupied by the instructions. If each instruction is loaded into memory at the location following the previous instruction, such counting will indicate the address of the next instruction. This counting is performed by the assembler and is maintained in the instruction counter (IC). The initial value of IC is 100 (decimal), so the machine code of the first instruction is constructed to load into memory starting from address 100. The IC is updated with each instruction line that allocates space in memory. After the assembler determines the length of the instruction, the IC is increased by the number of cells (words) occupied by the instruction, and thus it points to the next available cell.

As mentioned, to encode instructions in machine language, the assembler maintains a table that contains a corresponding code for each operation name. During translation, the assembler replaces each operation name with its code, and each operand is replaced with its corresponding encoding. However, this replacement process is not so simple. The instructions use various addressing methods for operands. The same operation can have different meanings in each addressing method, and therefore different encodings are applied depending on the addressing methods. For example, the `mov` operation can refer to copying the content of a memory cell to a register or copying the content of one register to another, and so on. Each such possibility of `mov` might have a different encoding.

The assembler needs to scan the entire instruction line and decide on the encoding based on the operands. Typically, the encoding is divided into a field for the operation name and additional fields containing information about the addressing methods. All fields together require one or more words in the machine code.

When the assembler encounters a label at the beginning of the line, it recognizes it as a label definition and assigns it an address, which is the current content of the IC. Thus, all labels receive their addresses at the time of definition. These labels are entered into the symbol table, which, in addition to the label name, contains the address and additional attributes. When a label is referred to in the operand of any instruction, the assembler can retrieve the corresponding address from the symbol table.

An instruction can also refer to a symbol that has not yet been defined in the program but will be defined later. For example, consider a branch instruction to an address defined by the label `A` that appears later in the code:

```assembly
bne A
...
A:
```

<!-- Second Pass -->
<h3 id="second-pass">üìâ Second Pass</h3>

As seen in the first pass, the assembler cannot construct the machine code of operands using symbols that have not yet been defined. Only after the assembler has scanned the entire program, so that all symbols have already been entered into the symbol table, can the assembler complete the machine code of all operands.

To achieve this, the assembler performs a second pass over the source code. During this pass, it updates the machine code for operands by substituting the symbols with their corresponding values from the symbol table. By the end of this second pass, the entire program is fully translated into machine code.

<!-- Input and Output Files -->
<h2 id="input-and-output-files">üñ®Ô∏è Input and Output Files of the Assembler</h2>

When running the assembler, command line arguments should include a list of source file names (one or more). These are text files containing programs written in the assembly language defined for this project.

The assembler processes each source file separately and generates the following output files:

- **`.am` file**: Contains the source file after the pre-assembler stage (after macro expansion).
- **`.ob` file**: Contains the machine code.
- **`.ext` file**: Includes details of all locations (addresses) in the machine code where an external symbol (declared with the `.extern` directive) is used.
- **`.ent` file**: Includes details of all symbols declared as entry points (declared with the `.entry` directive).

If the source file does not contain any `.extern` directives, the assembler will not create an `.ext` file. Similarly, if there are no `.entry` directives, an `.ent` file will not be generated.

Source file names must have the `.as` extension. For example, `hello.as`, `x.as`, and `y.as` are valid names. When passing these file names as arguments to the assembler, the extension is omitted.

Example:

```bash
./assembler x y hello
```

<!-- Object File Format -->
<h3 id="object-file-format">üñºÔ∏è Object File Format</h3>

The assembler constructs a memory image where the encoding of the first instruction from the assembly file is placed at address 100 (in decimal) in memory. The encoding of the second instruction is placed at the address following the first instruction (depending on the number of words in the first instruction), and so on until the last instruction.

Immediately after the encoding of the last instruction, the assembler places the encoding of the data created by `.data`, `.string`, and other data directives into the memory image. The data will be placed in the order it appears in the source file. An operand of an instruction referring to a symbol defined in the same file will be encoded to point to the appropriate location in the memory image created by the assembler.

Note that variables appear in the memory image after the instructions. This is why it is necessary to update the symbol table, at the end of the first pass, with the values of symbols defining data (symbols of type `.data`).

An object file fundamentally contains the described memory image. An object file is composed of text lines as follows:

- The first line of the object file is the "header," which contains two decimal numbers: the total length of the instruction section (in memory words) followed by the total length of the data section (in memory words). There is one space between the two numbers.

- The following lines in the file contain the memory image. Each line contains two values: the address of a memory word and the content of that word. The address is written in decimal, padded to four digits (including leading zeros), and the content is written in octal, padded to five digits (including leading zeros). There is one space between the two values on each line.

<!-- Entries File Format -->
<h3 id="entries-file-format">üè† Entries File Format</h3>

The entries file is composed of text lines. Each line contains the name of a symbol defined as an entry and its value, as found in the symbol table. The values are represented in decimal format.

The order of the labels in the file does not matter.

<!-- Externals File Format -->
<h3 id="externals-file-format">üåç Externals File Format</h3>

The externals file is also composed of text lines. Each line contains the name of a symbol defined as external and an address in machine code where an operand referring to this symbol is encoded. It is possible that there are multiple addresses in the machine code referring to the same external symbol. Each such reference will have a separate line in the externals file. The addresses are represented in decimal format.

Like in the Entries file, the order of the labels in the file does not matter.

<!-- Example Program -->

<!-- Installation -->
<h2 id="installation">üõ†Ô∏è Installation</h2>

Ready to build? Follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

**1.** Ensure you have a C compiler installed.

Run the following command to check if GCC is installed:

```bash
gcc --version
```

If you prefer Clang, you can check its installation with:

```bash
clang --version
```

**2.** Clone this repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talfig/Assembler.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory where the `makefile` is located using:

```bash
cd Assembler
```

Replace `Assembler` with the actual name of the directory if it differs.

**4.** Run the make command to compile the project and build the assembler:

```bash
make
```

The make command will read the `makefile` and execute the specified build instructions to compile the code and link the object files into an executable.

After the build process is complete, you should see the assembler executable in the project directory.
